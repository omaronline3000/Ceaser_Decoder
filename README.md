# Caesar Cipher Decoder

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher decoding algorithm in C++. It takes an encoded string and a key as input, then decodes it by reversing the shift applied during encoding. The Caesar Cipher is one of the most basic encryption techniques.

## Features
1. **Decode Text**:
   - Supports decoding for both uppercase and lowercase English letters.
   - Handles character wrapping when the shift exceeds 'A' or 'a'.

2. **Interactive Input**:
   - Prompts the user to input the encoded string and the key used for encoding.
